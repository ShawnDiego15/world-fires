# world-fires
A visualization of world fires.

This repository is part of exercise 16-9 from the Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. Exercise 16-9 is as follows: *In the resources for this chapter, youâ€™ll find a file called world_fires_1_day.csv. This file contains information about fires burning in different locations around the globe, including the latitude and longitude, and the brightness of each fire. Using the data processing work from the first part of this chapter and the mapping work from this section, make a map that shows which parts of the world are affected by fires.*

For this exercise, readers had to take the knowledge they learned regarding working with CSV files and apply it to the process we learned on plotting JSON data through Plotly. 

This repository consists of the following files:
- *world_fires_plot.py* - The main exectuable file for this program. This file contains the code necessary to read and extract data from the CSV file to plot on a world map.
- *world_fires.html* - A sample output one would expect when executing the python file.
- *world_fires_1_day.csv* - The data sample used for this project.
